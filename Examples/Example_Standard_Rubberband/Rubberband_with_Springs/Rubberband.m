% IB2d is an Immersed Boundary Code (IB) for solving fully coupled non-linear 
% 	fluid-structure interaction models. This version of the code is based off of
%	Peskin's Immersed Boundary Method Paper in Acta Numerica, 2002.

%
% This code is capable of creating Lagrangian Structures using:
% 	1. Springs
% 	2. Beams (*torsional springs)
% 	3. Target Points
%	4. Muscle-Model (combined Force-Length-Velocity model, "HIll+(Length-Tension)")
%
% One is able to update those Lagrangian Structure parameters, e.g., spring constants, resting %%	lengths, etc
% 
% There are a number of built in Examples, mostly used for teaching purposes. 
% 
% If you would like us %to add a specific muscle model, please let Nick (nick.battista@unc.edu) know.
