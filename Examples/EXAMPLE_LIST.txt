IB2d is an Immersed Boundary Code (IB) for solving fully coupled non-linear 
 	fluid-structure interaction models. This version of the code is based 
	off of Peskin's Immersed Boundary Method Paper in Acta Numerica, 2002.

%****************************% LIST OF EXAMPLES! %****************************%
%*****************************************************************************%

-THIS VERSION HAS 9 DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF EXAMPLES:
    1. "Standard Rubberband" - only uses springs between Lagrangian pts.
    2. "Wobbly Beam" - torsional springs between Lagrangian pts, w/ fixed ends 
        via target points
    3. "Moving Rubberband" - rubberband moving along a zig-zag pattern, via 
        updating target point positions
    4. "HeartTube" - examples of pumping in tubular hearts via updating_springs()
            ex1: - heart tube that pumps via muscle activation using combined 
                   length/tension - Hill model
            ex2: - heart tube that pumps via dynamic suction pumping by 
                   changing resting lengths of springs
            ex3: - heart tube that pumps via peristaltic waves of contraction 
                   by changing resting lengths of springs
            ex4: - heart that pumps via muscle activation by 3-element Hill Model
                   combined with a length-tension/force-velocity
    5. "Lymphangion" - tube that pumps via muscle activation using combined a
                   hybrid length/tension and Hill model
    6. "Channel_Flow" - various channel flow examples with parabolic flow being 
                        produced by arbitrary force on Eulerian grid
            ex1: - Flow around a cylinder in a channel
            ex2: - Flow around a cylinder with only one wall of channel
            ex3: - Flow in a channel with a hole in the channel
            ex4: - Flow produced in the middle of the channel
            ex5: - Flow produced in an empty channel
            ex6: - Flow in a channel, mocking an aneurysm
    7. "Pulsing_Heart" - cartoon heart that "pumps" via moving target points 
                         (interpolates between two phases)
    8. "Tracers" - examples of inserting tracer particles into simulations
            ex1: - Tracers in channel flow 
            ex2: - Tracers in an impedance pump
            ex3: - Tracers in a peristaltic pump
            ex4: - Tracers in bifurcating artery
    9. "Mass_Points" - "adding artificial mass" to the Lagrangian structure
            ex1: - 'massive' cell in pulsatile channel flow
            ex2: - 'massive' cells racing due to underlying fluid velocity only!
            ex3: - 'massive' cells racing under gravity only
            ex4: - 'massive' cells in 'gravity vs. pulsating flow'
    10. "Porous_Rubberband" - added porosity to standard rubberband problem
            ex1: - Single porous rubberband example
            ex2: - Comparing porous to non-porous rubberband
    11. "Concentration_Gradients"
            ex1: - Concentration gradient in birfuracting artery
            ex2: - Pure Diffusion of Passive Scalar in Box
    12. "Jellyfish_Swimming"
            ex1: - Bell composed entirely of springs, motion driven by updating
                   resting lengths sinusoidally
            ex2: - Bell composed of beams and springs
            ex3: - Bell motion driven by interpolating between resting lengths
                   for two phases.
            NOTE: not entirely debugged, yet.

%*********************************% NOTES! %**********************************%
%*****************************************************************************%

-It has the ability to read in Lagrangian Point Data (.vertex), Springs 
	(.spring), Torsional Springs (.beam),  Target Pts (.target), and 
	Muscle Pts (.muscle), 3-Hill-Muscle-Pts (.muscle_Hill), 
    Tracer Particles (.tracer), Mass Points (.mass), and  Porous Media (.porous), 
    and initial concentration (.concentration)!  

-It has the capabilitiy for updating model data:
    a. updating target point positions -> Example in Moving_Rubberband & 
       Pulsing_Heart
    b. updating_springs() -> Examples in HeartTube
    c. update_beams()    [can be made analogously] 
    d. update_muscles()  [can be made analogously]
    e. update_porosity() [can be made analogously]

-It can have pseudo-inflow conditions by inducing an arbitrary force onto the 
    Eulerian grid (e.g., Channel Flow Examples)

-You can choose to have gravity exerting forced (yes/no) as well as prescribe
    the direction of gravitational influence in any direction you'd wish, 
    in input2d

-You can have a background concentration gradient that is advected and diffused
    via the background flow.
